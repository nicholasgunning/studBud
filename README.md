### Design Iterations

The final website underwent several interactions due to various decisions made while coding up the prototype.

The first main change came with the media player, the one proposed in the mockups was very minimal and contained little information. While coding the player I realised that by incorporating the spotify embedded player it allowed for users to listen to a playlist that would be constantly updated without them worrying about having to upload music themselves. The spotify embedded player further is more visually pleasing for the user as it gives them a familiar experience that they may have likely experienced previously with spotify.

The second change came through the task box, the main task box is seen in the kanban board which allows users to enter tasks with their specified parameters. However, something that I believed was missing was a simple to do box where users could insert tasks without having to enter all the specific requirements such as due date etc. This task box was purposely kept quite barebones to allow the user to quickly input ideas and tasks as they came into their head.

The next change I made was the kanban board. Upon further user testing and feedback while coding the website I came to the conclusion the kanban board overloaded the user with large amounts of information and became very confusing at times. In order to counter this, I created a more simple layout which firstly allowed the user to add the various tasks to a task list as required by the brief and then could be dragged straight over. Features such as the filtering system provided no real benefit to the user and instead made them more confused in many ways. Instead the tasks would simply be filtered on how they entered them in. Something that I did want to keep on the kanban board though was the ability for users to access all the information they inputted on each card. This is something myself and the users who were tested on found very important. While the Kanban board did change greatly in the prototyping process their were still several aspects which stayed the same. Such as the content editable elements which allowed the user to customise their kanban according to them.
